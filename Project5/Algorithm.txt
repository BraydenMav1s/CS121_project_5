1. Create a file named data.csv.
    Copy the provided CSV data from Canvas into data.csv.

2. Use #include <iostream>, #include <fstream>, #include <sstream>, and #include <string>.

3. Open data.csv using ifstream.
    Check if the file opens correctly.

4. Use a while loop with getline() to read each line.
    Store each line into a string variable currentLine.

5. Clear converter and set it to currentLine.
    Use getline() to extract the first two numbers as strings (sNum1, sNum2).
        Use another getline() to extract the third value as a string (text).

6. Clear converter and reuse it.
    Convert sNum1 and sNum2 to integers using stringstream.

7. Add num1 and num2 and store it in sum.

8. Use a for loop to print text exactly sum times.
    Print a newline after each line.

9. Close data.csv using inFile.close().
